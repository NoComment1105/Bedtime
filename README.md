# Bedtime

<!-- Fun fact, this was written at 1am -->
Bedtime allows you to set custom notification times at which you will be reminded to go to bed. No more getting carried 
away and oops, it's, uh, 1am.

Through the power of 3 commands you can set up a reminder to go to bed at any time of the day!
