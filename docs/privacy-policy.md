# Bedtime Privacy Policy
For an overview of what Bedtime does, please refer to the [README.md](https://github.com/NoComment1105/Bedtime/blob/main/README.md)

I, NoComment, am not a lawyer, nor do I have the resources available to hire one. To the best of my ability I have 
written this document clearly, concisely and accurately. If you have any questions, please see the [Contact](#Contact) section

I have made sure Bedtime was written in such a way that it will collect and store as little data as possible. All data
collected is directly linked to the features in Bedtime. Under no circumstances will any collected data be sold or 
provided to a third party.

## Collected data

### To server owners
When a bedtime is set by a user, any data collected about the server the command was run in depends on what the user selects.
If the user sets the `dm` parameter to false in the `bed-time set` command, the `guildId` (Server ID) and the `channelId` will
be automatically extracted and stored in the database for the sole purpose of accessing the channel to send the bedtime 
notification in.

### To users
When you set a bedtime, your user id will be stored alongside your bedtime and bedtime message, if provided. This is collected
because it allows your bedtime reminder to be located successfully within the database when required. The other data stored is
the bedtime message and the bedtime itself, both of which are manually provided. 

## Contact
For questions or request for access or removal of person data, you may email me at nocomment1105@outlook.com. Alternatively
